1. re-implement + re-document the Talos bootstrap process. Don't accidentally delete it this time :D
2. configure talos with securty policy to allow Loki and prometheus-node-exporter to run. 
3. add cluster autoscaler
4. investigate how to neatly implement singleton clusters
5. implement AWS RBAC for external-secrets
6. configure `meta` environment as a singleton `prod` environment
7. document secrets needed for cluster + bootstrap
